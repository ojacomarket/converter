Angles are typically measured in radians, if not stated differently.

360 degrees = 1 full circle
2 PI radians = 1 full circle
1 radian = PI / 180 degrees (which make sense, since PI = 180 degrees)


Geocentric coordinates = Cartesian coordinates = has origin at (0,0,0), where (0,0,0) is a center of Earth's mass

Cartesian coordinate system is laid as follows:
- Z axis points to North (positives to North)
- X axis points to intersection between Greenwich meridian and equator (positives to East)
- Y axis rotated to +90 degress along equatorial plane


H - elevation above the geoid
H is positive, when point is above geoid
H is perpendicular to geoid (equipotential surface)
H = orthometric height = elevation above geoid

N = geoid separation
N is measured from ellipsoid along ellipsoid normal until it reaches geoid

h = N + H (approx.)
h = geodetic height

Geodetic system - framework, that helps to determine coordinates on Earth
Typically system uses geocentric Cartesian coordinates (geocentric = (0,0,0) at Earth Mass center), but Z
is pointing to the axis of Earth's rotation

WGS is geodetic system, that consist of reference ellipsoid and geoid
Basically, system defines its own (or uses existing) ellipsoid, from which calculations are made and geoid
to represent Earth as it is. However the standard is worldwide = WGS

There are also Local Geodetic Systems are called datums. Typically each LGS consist of:
a) horizontal datum
b) vertical datum

(a) and (b) doesn't depend on each other! LGS covers only small Earth's area of interest

Horizontal geodetic datums = earth-fixed (geocentric) reference ellipsoid
Datum = horizontal datum (if not stated differently)

Many LGS are connected to WGS.

Vertical datum = geoid surface (Mean Sea Level) , where h = 0 and positive if h > 0

///////////////////////////////// W G S 84
WGS84:
    - Z axis is parallel to Conventional Terrestrial Pole (CTP)
    - CTP is where Z-X and Z-Y plane cross on pole
    - Y axis point 90 degrees from Z and 90 deg from X
    - X axis points to the point of intersection Z-X and Z-Y plane on equator
    - is geocentric (0,0,0 at center of mass of Earth)

///////////////////////// Shifting between datums
Basically there are two main ways to shift:
a) if you change rotation angle of new coordinate system, offset , and scale factor also changes
b) if only offset present

How to shift between TWO LOCAL DATUMS?
Suppose we have two local datums (f) and (g), we want to shift from (f) to (g), how we do it?
    1. Shift from datum (f) to WGS84
    2. Shift from WGS84 to (g)

////////////////// Map Projection !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Map projection done in 3 steps:
    1. Goedetic coordinates (fi, teta, h) are reduced to ellipsoid (fi, teta, h=0)
    2. fi and teta are transformed into planar coordinates x,y
    3. Plot x,y on map

Mapping equation - equation that transform fi and teta to x and y

Conformal projection - preserving angles. For example, if on ellipsoid you can reach point B from point A, by
walking on the same angle (alpha), then on conformal projection (map) you can reach same point B using the same
(alpha) angle.

Scale factor vs Map scale???
--> Scale factor = ratio between arc on ellipsoid vs line on planar (map)
--> Map scale (what is put on chart) = distance on map vs distance on ellipsoid
For given map its "map scale" should change over the area of map very little amount (perfectly if reduced at all)

Convergence of meridian is an angle between NORTH on map and meridian grid lines (see image)
Convergence is positive clockwise and negative counterclockwise
Do not mess convergence with declination (NORTH and MAGNETIC NORTH difference)

//////// M E R C A T O R     P R O J E C T I O N
    - scale factor = 1 at equator
    - not defined at poles (NORHT POLE, SOUTH POLE do not use this projection)
    - conformal projection
    - equator at y = 0

Parallels and meridians are used on Mercator projection
Parallels are horisontal lines across map
Meridians - vertical lines across map
Parallel represent Y axis and satisfies (y = const)
Meridians represent X axis and satisfies (x = const)
At poles distance between parallels increasing due to distortion

For example at 60 degrees of latitude the scale factor is approx. 2
At 80 degrees - 5.7


/////////// T R A N S V E R S E     M E R C A T O R
scale factor = 1 at Greenwich Meridian (along vertical line)

y = 0 is a equator parallel line
x = 0 is a meridian vertical line (Greenwhich)

The UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) is modification of TM (Tranverse Mercator)

Transverse Mercator = straight line at EQUATOR (parallel) and meridian (vertical)

//////////// U N I V E R S A L    T R A N S V E R S E     M E R C A T O R
While Transverse Mercator is used within 4 degrees of longitude (4W or 4E), then it is only practical use for
England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, but not Estonia

For us is better to use modification of Transverse Mercator = Universal Transverse Mercator, that is used
within 3 + 6 * n, where n = 0...59 degrees of longitude

Scale factor along central meridian (Greenwich) is 0.9996

y value is 0 at equator an 10 000 000m at North Pole
y value is 10 000 000m at equator and 0 at South Pole

x has origin of 500 000 at central meridian

Basically:
    x --> |
          |
          |
    y --> _________________


y called as NORTHING
x called as EASTING

UTM Projection use UTM Zones, in total there are 60 UTM zones, 6 degree each
UTM Zones are covered in:
    - 84 degree of NORTH
    - 80 degree of SOUTH
    - other areas are covered by Universal Polar Stereographic (UPS)
First zone begin at longitude 180degrees --> 186 degrees and moving from WEST --> EAST

To find UTM projection coordinates from geodetic coordinates:
    1. First compute UTM Zone
    2. Compute (radians value) central meridian
    3. Knowing central meridian value go ahead and compute x,y of Transverse Mercator (UTM is based on TM):
