Angles are typically measured in radians, if not stated differently.

360 degrees = 1 full circle
2 PI radians = 1 full circle
1 radian = PI / 180 degrees (which make sense, since PI = 180 degrees)


Geocentric coordinates = Cartesian coordinates = has origin at (0,0,0), where (0,0,0) is a center of Earth's mass

Cartesian coordinate system is laid as follows:
- Z axis points to North (positives to North)
- X axis points to intersection between Greenwich meridian and equator (positives to East)
- Y axis rotated to +90 degress along equatorial plane
